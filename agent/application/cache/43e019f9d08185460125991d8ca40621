<br />
<strong>TIPU’S PALACE </strong><br />
The palace and the fort of Tipu Sultan are the must-see spot in Bangalore. The architecture, the layout and the overall look of the palace give you the idea of the ethnic Mughal lifestyle.

While actually located in Andhra Pradesh, Lepakshi is most easily accessible from Bengaluru (Bangalore), and is the site of the Veerbhadra Temple.<br />

Look for the 9m-long monolithic Nandi – India’s largest – at the town’s entrance. From here, you can see the temple’s Naga-lingam (a phallic representation of Shiva) crowned with a seven-headed cobra. The Natyamandapa (Dance Hall) ceiling frescoes are absolutely stunning.<br />

The 12th-century Hoysala temples at Belur (also called Beluru) are the apex of one of the most artistically exuberant periods of ancient Hindu cultural development. The main temple, dedicated to Vishnu, has been a place of worship for over 900 years.<br />
<br />
Construction of the Hoysaleswara Temple, Halebid’s claim to fame, began around 1121 and went on for more than 80 years. It was never completed but nonetheless stands today as a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture. The interior of its inner sanctum, chiselled out of black stone, is marvellous. On the outside, the temple’s richly sculpted walls are covered with a flurry of Hindu deities, sages, stylised animals, and friezes depicting the life of the Hoysala rulers.<br />
